title: Learn Spatial Analytics
---

Here are some resources that I think might be helpful for someone learning about spatial analytics for the first time. This is only going to include open source materials because getting access to GIS software is a bit challenging.

- Spatial context or location is playing a growing role in understanding the world, so to understand why spatial data is important start with this: [Introduction to Spatial Data and GIS](https://youtu.be/eTLCpEq29gc?feature=shared) - 
- To get an idea on the importance of maps in the digital age, check out this [TedTalk on GIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V_Mz7NDy3o)
- Another excellent [TedTalk:The Whys of Where](https://youtu.be/cBEPZ1Yoirg?feature=shared) summarized with a quote: "A good map helps you to ask a better question."

## Other Beginner Material (If you have little coding or statistics experience)
- If you have a background in statistics these two lectures ([Part A](https://youtu.be/JwHxJsesG2Y?feature=shared) and [Part B](https://youtu.be/6LDvT9qK8TY?feature=shared)) may help give you a bridge for how certain methods translate from a traditional stats approach to a spatial analytics approach.
- This is a nice [introduction to the foundational applied methods](https://www.wvview.org/mos.html) for data cleaning, visualization, and analytics (in R and Python)
