title: Learn Spatial Analytics
---

Here are some resources that I think might be helpful for someone learning about spatial analytics for the first time. This is only going to include open source materials because getting access to GIS software is a bit challenging.

- Spatial context or location is playing a growing role in understanding the world, so to understand why spatial data is important start with this: [Introduction to Spatial Data and GIS](https://youtu.be/eTLCpEq29gc?feature=shared) - 
- To get an idea on the importance of maps in the digital age, check out this [TedTalk on GIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V_Mz7NDy3o)
- Another excellent [TedTalk:The Whys of Where](https://youtu.be/cBEPZ1Yoirg?feature=shared) summarized with a quote: "A good map helps you to ask a better question."

## Other Beginner Material (If you have little coding or statistics experience)
- If you have a background in statistics these two lectures ([Part A](https://youtu.be/JwHxJsesG2Y?feature=shared) and [Part B](https://youtu.be/6LDvT9qK8TY?feature=shared)) may help give you a bridge for how certain methods translate from a traditional stats approach to a spatial analytics approach.
- This is a nice [introduction to the foundational applied methods](https://www.wvview.org/mos.html) for data cleaning, visualization, and analytics (in R and Python) 

## <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/50/python--v1.png" height="50px"> Python
- If you want to start learning Python check out the video lectures from Spatial Thoughts: [Foundation for Spatial Analytics](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLppGmFLhQ1HJspXSA0asH9kw1OhlLrxHT&feature=shared)

## <img src="https://img.icons8.com/windows/32/r-project.png" height="50px"> R
- R is also a fine place to start, check out these free materials on [Open Source Spatial Analytics](https://www.wvview.org/os_sa.html)
- Perhaps check out this additional course on [Spatial Data Science with R and the terra Library](https://rspatial.org/#google_vignette) 

## <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/50/qgis.png" height="50px"> QGIS
- For a brief [introduction to the QGIS](https://courses.spatialthoughts.com/introduction-to-qgis.html) suite, Spatial Thoughts has some material
- Check out this playlist of videos to dive into some more [intermediate tools with QGIS](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLxyyob7YmEHFg5xvwszKIo_sNZbczlNC&feature=shared)

## <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/50/place-marker--v1.png" height="50px"> Other Open Source Tools
- Try out the free online web mapping tool: [Felt with these videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLulpFBGeM9D56pqKcZYKOb_r10ax0Vzhy&feature=shared)
- For another open source tool for spatiala analytics take a llok into [GeoDa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRTUkUbzpC4)
- If you want more on web maps and have some experience with JS - [Leaflet Tutorials](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDmvslp_VR0xjh7wGMNd_1kk0zUox6Sue&feature=shared) may be up your alley
